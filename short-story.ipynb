Willing his heart to slow down, he crept closer, still wary of potential danger.\n",

Occasionally, late in the evening, he would venture out of his safe haven to search for carrots and to check in on his human friends. Bob’s life was simple, but oh so sweet-a true piece of paradise in the forest he called home.\n"
